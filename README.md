Kinect-ECE-XText
================

This repository contains the code about a project for the Artificial Intelligence course of the University of Bologna.

The project is about the implementation of an editor for Event-Condition-Expectation (ECE) rules in XText to target our Drools implementation. The editor will also allow to deploy Kinect applications on the fly.
